   ## My Challanges and lessons
   Learnt how to display elements with proper grid systems and making them responsive on mobile view, and also the nav-bar functioned by js was quite interseting with little defects at the beginning due to wrong assignments of element classes and ID to the functions.
            
   ## Installations
   ## Important!
   - Due to prevention of larger file output, the pictures were not placed in their proper directories i.e [images/something.img], this directory should be used for all the images that are without a folder in them.
   - To view the clean output of this project you can check it out on this Drop-box link that's here [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b40gpzo1qg9zl78/AABUXH_EGbK07v93BzP3Ofdua?dl=0]
   - For those who use git-hub can also pull or clone this repo but make sure you create a folder with the name images then add all the pictures there. It should look like this (images/something.img).
   - For those who want to view you can download the file from here [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b40gpzo1qg9zl78/AABUXH_EGbK07v93BzP3Ofdua?dl=0], to view Thank you once again.
